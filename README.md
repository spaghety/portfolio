# Portfolio

This is the main page of my personal domain/server at [pajordan.com](https://pajordan.com/). More official subdomains dedicated to various
projects will be soon to follow. My portfolio website is being run with docker compose on a network managed by an nginx reverse proxy system that
manages all incoming requests. You can find my reverse proxy repository [here](https://github.com/spaghety/reverse-proxy/).

I originally created this portfolio with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). Howeever, since CRA has been deprecated,
I'm looking to move on to use something more current like Next.js and take more advantage of the modularity that react offers.
